## Detailed Error Analysis

### ðŸ”´ False Positive Analysis

**Root Causes:**
1. **Over-sensitive threshold**: The system flags normal high-activity periods as anomalies
2. **Lack of context awareness**: Doesn't distinguish between legitimate and malicious high activity
3. **Poor feature engineering**: Activity scores don't capture behavioral patterns effectively

**False Positive Characteristics:**
- **Average Activity Score**: 2.362 (60min) to 14.650 (720min)
- **Activity Level**: 0.378-0.397 (moderate activity)
- **File Accesses**: 30-40 accesses per interval
- **Network Connections**: 16-34 connections per interval

**What Went Wrong:**
- The Markov chain similarity method is too sensitive to activity spikes
- No consideration of user-specific baselines or work patterns
- Threshold of 0.85-0.9 is too low for the feature set used
- KL divergence may not be the optimal similarity measure for this data

### ðŸ”´ False Negative Analysis

**Root Causes:**
1. **Subtle attack patterns**: Many malicious activities don't create obvious activity spikes
2. **Threshold too high**: Some legitimate anomalies are missed
3. **Feature limitations**: Current features don't capture sophisticated attack patterns

**False Negative Characteristics:**
- **Average Activity Score**: 35.633-136.854 (higher than false positives)
- **Activity Level**: 0.416-0.765 (moderate to high activity)
- **Data Transfer**: 118.467 MB average (significant data movement)
- **Network Connections**: 34-43 connections per interval

**What Went Wrong:**
- Attacks with moderate activity levels are missed
- Sophisticated attacks that blend with normal traffic aren't detected
- The Markov chain approach may not capture temporal attack patterns effectively
- Lack of multi-modal detection (file access + network + data transfer patterns)

## Technical Issues Identified

### 1. **Markov Chain Limitations**
- **Problem**: Markov chains assume memoryless transitions, but insider threats have temporal dependencies
- **Impact**: Misses sophisticated attack sequences that span multiple time periods
- **Solution**: Implement Hidden Markov Models (HMM) or LSTM-based sequence modeling

### 2. **Feature Engineering Problems**
- **Problem**: Current features are too aggregated and lose temporal information
- **Impact**: Can't distinguish between legitimate and malicious activity patterns
- **Solution**: Add sequence-based features, user-specific baselines, and behavioral patterns

### 3. **Threshold Optimization Issues**
- **Problem**: Fixed thresholds don't adapt to different users or time periods
- **Impact**: High false positive rate and missed detections
- **Solution**: Implement dynamic thresholding based on user behavior and time context

### 4. **Similarity Method Problems**
- **Problem**: KL divergence may not be optimal for this type of data
- **Impact**: Poor discrimination between normal and anomalous patterns
- **Solution**: Test multiple similarity measures and ensemble approaches

### 5. **Time Window Issues**
- **Problem**: Fixed time windows don't capture variable-length attack patterns
- **Impact**: Attacks spanning multiple windows are missed or fragmented
- **Solution**: Implement adaptive time windows and sliding window analysis

## Recommendations for Improvement

### ðŸŽ¯ Immediate Fixes (High Impact, Low Effort)

#### 1. **Threshold Optimization**
```python
# Dynamic threshold based on user behavior
def calculate_dynamic_threshold(user_history, current_activity):
    user_baseline = np.mean(user_history['activity_scores'])
    user_std = np.std(user_history['activity_scores'])
    return user_baseline + 2 * user_std
```

#### 2. **Feature Engineering Improvements**
```python
# Add sequence-based features
def extract_sequence_features(activity_sequence):
    return {
        'activity_trend': calculate_trend(activity_sequence),

        'pattern_similarity': compare_with_user_baseline(activity_sequence),
        'time_context': get_time_context_features(activity_sequence)
    }
```

#### 3. **Multi-Modal Detection**
```python
# Combine multiple detection methods
def ensemble_detection(file_activity, network_activity, data_transfer):
    markov_score = markov_detection(file_activity)
    network_score = network_anomaly_detection(network_activity)
    transfer_score = data_transfer_analysis(data_transfer)
    
    return weighted_ensemble([markov_score, network_score, transfer_score])
```

```python
# LSTM-based sequence modeling
class AnomalyLSTM(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, batch_first=True)
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        lstm_out, _ = self.lstm(x)
        return torch.sigmoid(self.classifier(lstm_out[:, -1, :]))
```

## Conclusion

The current AgenticRAG implementation with Markov chain anomaly detection has fundamental limitations that result in poor performance. The high false positive and false negative rates indicate that the approach needs significant improvements in:

1. **Algorithm selection**: Markov chains are too simplistic for complex insider threat detection
2. **Feature engineering**: Current features lack temporal and contextual information
3. **Threshold optimization**: Fixed thresholds don't adapt to different scenarios
4. **Multi-modal detection**: Single method is insufficient for complex threats

The recommended improvements, especially the transition to HMM-based detection and user-specific baselines, should significantly improve performance and make the system more practical for real-world deployment.

**Next Steps**: Implement Phase 1 improvements and re-evaluate performance with the enhanced feature set and dynamic thresholding approach.
